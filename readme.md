# How I have created Interactive Gallery
In this interactive gallery assignment, I have decided to make a baby photo album

I have chosen just square boxes and the image name on the left top corner of the image with overlay. It seems normal gallery, I wanted to make Masonry grid type
But this seems very well then mesonary so I have chosen Fixed aspect ratio grids to make it proper standard grid layout
# HTML layout creation
I have chosen the standard HTML symentic format to create my HTML page, WHich makes is simple, formal and easy.
# Grid Layout creation
In order to create grid layout to fulfil the designing need I have recalled all the grid assignament we have explored in previous class.
Previou  assignments and some grid experiments help to get the exact layout I wanted to make for my grid gallery.
I have prefered to use grid layout because I can make responsive layout easily with the help of grid. Other methods are lenghty and need more time, But this method is best. Just one line of the code do the rest.

# Additional Feactures
I have used an animation to make to look more better.
I was searching on internet some fast way to add animations on website and I came across the animate.css examples and solutions.
Then I have dowloded animate.css from this site https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/
Added it to files folder of my assignament 
Then I have seen some youtube videos and some websites which shows How can I use animate.css in my website ( I had some Idea about it as I have used it when I was working in IT company back in India)

# Color selection
I have chosen simple colors and used it uniformaly on gallery so that It can look more better

# photos and resources used.
I have dowbloaded the royalty free photographs from pixels.

# Challenged and What I have learned.

The very first challenge was to display images dynamically using the javascript.
I ahve referred many examples and online youtube videos, I have also check W3scholl and other solutions on google.
https://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html
I was not able to get the image dynamically from the internet, I has asked my housemate studying in carleton.
She was not able to solve it
Then I came across the solution

https://www.aspsnippets.com/Articles/Display-Images-from-JSON-Array-using-JavaScript.aspx
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9424759/swap-multiple-images-from-javascript-array

Then I made different different experiments.

Gethering some idea from everywhere I was able to make it possible.
But I was also stuck while merging html and javascript, I have googled it for the solution.
Thoug  I had to make many experiments to get it done.


While creating grid layout I was missing something So I had to check my previous grid assignments and some online searches.
Then I was able to make it the way I wanted.

While displaying the name on image on grid layout, I had to retrive the attribute from the javascript file to CSS file.
( Previously I didn't know how to do it and I was about to quit the idea of displaying the name of image on image )
Then I searched on google about it and found solution using attr() in css file.
Then I have adde name property in javascript file with their value and it worked.


To get the proper image proportion and make it perfectly fit for the image size
I have styled using styling the javascript element, 
I have taken reference from https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_css.asp and other google searches to get it done.


# I have learned somany things in this assignment

CSS javascript communication

Use of animation
Seems like Now I will be able to do the animation assignments easily.
